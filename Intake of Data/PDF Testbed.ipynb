their'], ['I  2 selling prices further in the second half of 2008 and/or early 2009', ' While some contacts express worry that price increases have led or will lead to losses of market share, others indicate that their customers have become more receptive to price increases because they see them as a consequence of generalized cost pressures', ' About onehalf of manufacturing respondents are contemplating (mostly small) layoffs in the second half of 2008', ' Some of the remaining firms are continuing to recruit for added science and engineering positions', ' On the whole, contacts raised U', 'S', ' wages and salaries in the first half of 2008 and plan no further adjustments this year, particularly since turnover rates have stabilized or declined', ' However, some note upward pressures because employees are increasingly voicing dissatisfaction with their pay in light of rising living costs', ' Manufacturers generally say that secondhalf capital spending will remain in line with their annual plans, reflecting needed investments', ' Some mention they will be taking a harder look at discretionary spending, and a few indicate that ongoing financial market distress is deterring

are increasing salaries less this year than they did last year', ' The majority of New England consulting respondents expect steady revenue growth for the remainder of 2008, although they remain concerned about the economy', ' Commercial Real Estate Sentiment was decidedly morose among commercial real estate contacts this cycle, with the exception of a small mutual bank that continues to enjoy robust demand for its smallscale commercial'], ['I  3 property loans', ' Contacts in Providence, Boston, and Hartford all indicate that leasing activity was very slow in recent weeks, even slower than expected based on seasonal considerations', ' They say that businesses are stalling on lease renewals in the expectation of getting more favorable deals in the near future as the market continues to soften', ' Still, no dramatic increases in vacancy rates have emerged as yet', ' In the metropolitan areas of Boston, Hartford, and Providence, office rent growth appears close to zero after concessions are taken into account', ' The industrial property market has been very weak in both Connecticut and Rhode Island—in the latter case, vacancies are up and rents are down (both

been hit particularly hard', ' For example, three major building projects in downtown Boston (office and mixeduse high rises) are said to be currently languishing as they scramble to obtain tenant commitments and financing', ' As evidence that property valuations have fallen relative to operating incomes, sources report that capitalization rates for commercial property in greater Boston are now approaching 7 percent, up from last summer’s estimated 5 percent', ' Despite enjoying brisk business and high commercial mortgage interest rates, a small Boston mutual bank foresees that it could run up against lending capacity constraints before year’s end', ' Accordingly, lending officers at the bank have been instructed to adopt a “more selective” stance', ' Compared with the last report, contacts are less optimistic that market conditions will improve by year’s end', ' One commercial broker is cautioning his clients to be prepared for a long period of stagnation in commercial property
